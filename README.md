# bone xl distortion pedal
I recently got into electronics, and as a musician, I thought a guitar pedal would be a fun project. I followed this awesome tutorial by Brian Wampler of Wampler 
Pedals https://www.wamplerpedals.com/blog/lifestyle-hobby/2024/08/how-to-design-a-basic-distortion-pedal-circuit/. The circuit is slightly different (I use a 
different op-amp), but all credit for the circuit design should go to Brian. This is my first project learning and using KiCad for PCB design.
